# Automatic-Traffic-Ticket-System

This system is designed to streamline the handling of traffic violations through automation and AI technologies. It includes several key modules:

- **AI Recognition Module**  
  Automatically detects license plates using AI.

- **Manual Review Module**  
  Handles low-confidence cases through human validation.

- **Vehicle Data Management**  
  Retrieves registration data for identified vehicles.

- **Ticket Issuing Module**  
  Automatically generates and sends fines once a violation is confirmed.

- **National Dashboard**  
  Monitors all violation events in real time for centralized oversight.

I was responsible for the **Ticket Issuing and Notification Module**, which automates the fine creation process and connects it with the alerting system to ensure timely and accurate ticket delivery.
